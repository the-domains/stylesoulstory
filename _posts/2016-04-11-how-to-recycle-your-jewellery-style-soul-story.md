description: "When it comes to recycling, jewellery may not be the first thing you think of. Did you know you can mail your jewellery to be recycled for free? I love the idea that if things don't bring you joy they should not be around, and as part of my 2016 New Years Resolutions have taken up de-cluttering my wardrobe and drawers, once and for all."
